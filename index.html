        <p>
            A roof garden is essentially a garden on the rooftop of a building, man-made green spaces on the topmost level of residential and commercial structures. 
            Consisting of different plants, these verdant areas help improve a buildingâ€™s aesthetics.
            Rooftop gardens have been in existence for a long time now. 
            The people of ancient Mesopotamia have grown trees and shrubs atop ziggurats. 
            Some European homes in the olden days had roofs made with turf.  
            And the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, are known to have tiered gardens with lots of vegetation.

        <h2>Why we need Rooftop Gardening or Farming?</h2>
        <p>
            A roof garden is any type of vegetation established on the roof of a building. 
            Apart from the decorative benefit, roof garden serves the purpose of providing architectural enhancement, temperature control, recreational opportunities, habitats for wildlife and food. 
            The method of cultivating food on the rooftop is referred to as rooftop farming. 
            It is usually carried out with the help of container gardens, air-dynaponics systems or aeroponics, hydroponics or green roof. 
            Additional platforms known as "aero-bridges" can also be formed between high-rise buildings in addition to the roof space.
